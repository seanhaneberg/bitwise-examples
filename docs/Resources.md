### Code

["Code" by Charles Petzold](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)

### Hacker's Delight

["Hacker's Delight" by Henry Warren](https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Delight-2nd-Henry-Warren/dp/0321842685)

This book provides a ton of real-world patterns for working with a constrained
system and, more often than not, using bitwise operations to implement effecient
code.

The book is really dense and is kind of impossible to "sit down and read." It's
a good reference book and covers a wide range of bitwise optimizations.
