## Bitwise Operators Overview

Existing documents give an in-depth overview of bitwise operations:

- [Bitwise operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation)
- [Bit manipulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_manipulation)

Here's an overview I put together:

## Authentic uses of bitwise operators

Bitwise operators allow developers to evaluate and change the individual bits
that make up a number.

There are a few reasons developers might need to use bitwise operators.
Consequently, you should expect that they will show up from time to time in
coding interviews, especially when a position requires working in low-level
platform code.
